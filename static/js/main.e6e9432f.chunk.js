He is always willing to pitch in and try something new, even if it\'s not a true development task. He never takes constructive criticism personally; he\'s always willing to go back and rework a feature to make it even better, which is of course how we all improve our skills over time. He is very sociable and gets along with just about everybody - he\'s good with both clients and colleagues which is something I definitely can\'t say about every developer I\'ve worked with!
