He is truly a pleasure to work with, he always has a positive 'can-do' attitude and if he doesn't know something is not afraid to ask or to research it. He is always willing to pitch in and try something new, even if it's not a true development task. He never takes constructive criticism personally; he's always willing to go back and rework a feature to make it even better, which is of course how we all improve our skills over time. He is very sociable and gets along with just about everybody - he's good with both clients and colleagues which is something I definitely can't say about every developer I've worked with! Mikey is a hard worker and a great person to have on your team and I'd really enjoy working with him again given the opportunity."
