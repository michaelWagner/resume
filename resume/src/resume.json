    "background": "Recently, I delivered a highly collaborative and scaled game where Google developers could reveal the date for the upcoming I/O conference by solving interactive puzzles. Previously, I have rapidly architected, implemented, and delivered responsive applications under tight deadlines using Scrum methodologies for companies like Honda, AT&T, AWS, and Intuit. During my time working with Honda, I was given the task of building a prototype for their upcoming car’s dashboard experience, and got to collaborate with the small R&D team. Additionally I was part of the team that built an enterprise level application for AT&T to help businesses dynamically select and configure complex VPN packages.",
